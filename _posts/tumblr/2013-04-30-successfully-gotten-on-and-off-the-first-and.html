<p>Successfully gotten on and off the first and second flight without all too many issues. There was a bit of a security mishap at the front end which meant a departure fifteen minutes later than planned, but it didn’t particularly retard the flight. </p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, though the flight was later than most people’s dinner times, we were provided with a nice amount of food. I had a beef stew that was primarily potatoes; and potatoes are always good. (Really, it is probably pretty hard to mess up cooking a potato…)</p>

<p>Despite my track record of staying up for entire international flights, it appears to have grown old enough to understand the merits of plane sleeping. After watching Django Unchained—Virgin Atlantic’s movie selection was incredibly vast and I was impressed that everything was free—I took advantage of the fact that no one was sitting in one of the seats next to me and took a nap.</p>

<p>Getting to London after that took no time at all. Winding through the various buildings of LHR, I got on my flight to Aberdeen and slept the entire time. Although I did manage to wake up in time to get a bag of potato chips (crisps as the bag named them).</p>

<p>Sitting in the Aberdeen airport, I have to wait another 40 minutes to know which gate I am going to be leaving out of… this airport is cute in the sense that it is small. </p>

<p>So small that it’s the kind that you climb up stairs to get into and off of the plane. Doing so arriving here proved that weather is going to be much chillier than home. I’m quite excited for it though, right now at least is a comfortable mix of chill and partial blue sky.</p>

<p>I have investigated how I am going to get to the hostel I am going to be staying at… Though I probably should start figuring out the food situation. While the sun may not set until 9, that doesn’t mean that restaurants won’t close before then… Oof.</p>
