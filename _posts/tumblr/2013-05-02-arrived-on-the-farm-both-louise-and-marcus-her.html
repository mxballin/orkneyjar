<p>Arrived on the farm. Both Louise and Marcus (her son), are fantastically nice. Mark is on Faray preparing for lambing season, so I have yet to meet him.</p>

<p>On the way up, I saw the local owl as well as some of of the teensy bunnies that the farm is &ldquo;infested&rdquo; with, as Louise called it.</p>

<p>She also mentioned that there is a ranger on the island who could lead me on walks, etc., which sounds like an awesome opportunity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already gotten my gear on (overalls and boots over my own clothes) to work with the cows. Each one has a name and I think Louise said there are about 100+, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m about to learn all of their names at once.</p>

<p>Marcus has two beautiful dogs which are both quite friendly, and there are birds all over the barn.</p>

<p>Overall the farm is very peaceful and spacious. I am quite excited to spend time here.</p>
