<p>Today was a bit more of the same and a bit of new.</p>

<p>The morning consisted of breakfast, working the byres, and de-thistling and weeding the polytunnel.</p>

The calves were incredibly cute today when I went to feed them. Perhaps because I have been feeding them for the set couple days (called on the farm &lsquo;calf creeps,&rsquo; but I&rsquo;m not quite sure why) but they seemed much more willing to investigate my outstretched hand. Most stared at it for a while before inching forward a bit more and sticking their tongue just slightly out of their mouth as if they were pondering whether my fingers were lickable or not. If they decided yes, they would come forward, take a few swipes with their incredibly coarse and slobbery tongue and then jump back and start the process all over again. Those that weren&rsquo;t all too sure of me just scampered away after a while.

I discovered another trait of cows as well. Marcus brought a new bale of hay into the barn and almost immediately every cow that was let out of their pen while it was being cleaned decided that it would be the best thing ever to rub their head against it quite vigorously. I&rsquo;m told its basically just a fun thing they like doing. Later on when I had a tightly bunched together pile of straw that I was pulling apart to bed down one of the calf pens, one of the calves was trying the same thing with the straw against my leg and near knocked me over with his enthusiasm. Absolutely adorable but a tad frightening as well, i wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to feel the strength of a full sized cow doing that!

<p>Lunch was delightfully long, perhaps because the gloomy weather left none of us wanting to work outside (or prevented us from being able to do the work we needed to). Interestingly enough, though this weather isn’t uncommon for Scotland, both Marcus and Louise have said that it is a bit unusual for this time of year. In fact, it makes it a little harder for farming because the fields can’t be worked in the rain without getting ruined.</p>

<p>One of the things that has really captured my interest here is how much science and effort actually goes in to the workings of  Fersness. I went up to Scale with Marcus again today before dinner and he talked a lot about how much analysis and planning the Cockrams put into taking care of their cows and sheep. Every year they have their soil and silage analyzed in order to make sure that their animals are getting a proper balance of nutrients; and if it doesn’t come from the grass, they make sure to supplement with a mineral powder that gets dusted on top of the silage (one of my other fiddley bit jobs). The acidity of the silage this year was exceptionally high, and so those cows that eat however much they like are given bicarbonate powder in order to help them digest (like cow alka seltzer). The care the family takes of their cows and the understanding they have of them is incredible, I think. They describe often the small nuances of a cow’s posture and how it acts as an indicator as to how the cow is feeling. I’ll be honest, I noticed some of the things when they were pointed out, but other times it felt like an absolute smile and wave moment. And really the science behind it in and of itself is baffling. The cows at scale and the cows in the smaller barn are situated on slatted floor than is much more comfortable for them than the large byre (which is set to be renovated in a couple of years). On my first visit to Scale, Marcus mentioned that it makes the cows so much more comfortable that they grow about 30someodd percent more than those on cement. Genetics are also a huge factor and the hybridization and decisions for who to breed are incredibly important. Supposedly, docility of the cows can be hereditary and is even noticeable in their genes.</p>

<p>Right after lunch, to go back in time a bit, I went with Louise to the store to get a bit more of a look at the island and also just to see what it was like. It reminded me a bit of a fabulously stocked college shop that also had things a bit more essential to life at home and not in a tiny dorm room at school. The majority of the food and processed items are of the brand ‘the cooperative,’ which works closely with farmers and producers to be fair to them and to also give good prices to the consumer. At the same time, though, because Eday is such a small island it seems like stock is quite limited. Islanders have a running order for various things that the store might otherwise run out of before they can go in during the week, and vegetables are primarily frozen, those that aren&rsquo;t look a bit sad compared to the glowing aisles of produce back at home.

After finishing up shopping, we took a different way back which gave me the opportunity to see a couple of other farms as well as the Stone of setter which is the tallest Neolithic stone in all of orkney. I looks kind of strange just standing in the middle of nowhere, but Louise says it is a lovely walk to go see it, so perhaps I&rsquo;ll try and make my way up there sometime soon.

Upon returning I helped in the byre and as before mentioned went to Scale with Marcus. When we came back, dinner was ready and Georgina, another of Louise&rsquo;s children, was home from school. She&rsquo;s a year younger than I am and is now finished with her classes and only has exams left. I didn&rsquo;t have much of a chance to talk to her today but she seems just as kind and funny as the rest of the family that I have met so far. 

Didn&rsquo;t have a chance to take any photos really today other than a couple around the house. At least that is something. I am hoping one night to be able to shoot at night for a bit as there isn&rsquo;t any light pollution to speak of here, really&hellip; I was also told my first day here that the Northern Lights crop up upon occasion. Man, that would be a treat. I did give Marcus a bunch of advice on picking a camera tonight. He is looking at buying a DSLR, so hopefully I managed to point him in the direction he is wanting to go in.

The Internet, though showing full bars, is refusing to cooperate as is cell reception probably because of the weather. It&rsquo;s back for a while now though, so that is a good sign.

Marcus said that, weather depending, he would show me around a couple of beaches tomorrow. There is a quarry on the property that looks pretty awesome as it is right up against the shore. Regardless a new calf was born tonight and I am excited to meet it when I work the byre tomorrow. </p>
