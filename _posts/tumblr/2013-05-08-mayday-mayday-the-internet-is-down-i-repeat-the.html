<p>Mayday mayday, the Internet is down. I repeat, the Internet is down. Or at least it was&hellip;</p>

<p>Yesterday was quite nice. Did the byre in the morning and then worked on cleaning up a plow for Marcus so he could put it away for the summer. He was out fertilizing, so there wasn&rsquo;t really much for me to do.</p>

<p>I came back in for lunch and then went for a walk down to Seal Skerry, which is a small point a bit of a ways from the farm, but still on their land. When the tide is low, much more of the point is revealed and seals come to sunbathe, hence the name. It was quite windy, though, when I was there, and not a seal was in sight. Regardless it was a beautiful walk.</p>

<p>After that, I went out on the point&ndash;the bit of land just past the farm that ends at the sea&ndash;with Mark and Louise to help ring and number some lambs. I hadn&rsquo;t really worked with the sheep before so it was a nice switch up. The lambs are absolutely tiny, and they have barely anything to them other than their bones, a bit of meat, and their wrinkly skin with a bit of wooly curls.</p>

<p>Basically we found a sheep and her lamb or lambs that hadn&rsquo;t been processed yet, nabbed the lamb with a crook (a stick with a c-shaped curve at the end of it), then placed a rubber ring around its tail. If it was a boy, a ring would also be placed around his testicals. The rings cut off blood circulation and allow the appendages to come off. In terms of the tail, it was a bit of a surprise as I had always just thought that sheep naturally had shorter tails like with deer or rabbits. In fact, they are shortened by farmers because their diets n a farm cause them to create a higher amount of manure than in the wild, and therefore the tail would just get in the way of that. Once their rings were on, we numbered them with what is essentially a livestock spray paint, green for twins and blue for singles.</p>

<p>Making sure that the lambs got back to their mothers after we were done with them was a bit more tricky of a process than I had expected. Sheep are, to be blunt, quite stupid, and in many cases as soon as we had the lamb in our arms, she ran off thinking he had gotten lost. Mark often made a bleating noise if the lamb itself wasn&rsquo;t calling, which helped to keep the mother around. There was one, though, that we had to follow with the lamb in the car with us because she was heading off in the absolutely incorrect direction, and couldn&rsquo;t be swayed to go otherwise. It&rsquo;s a bit sad, really, to think that they could get lost that quickly and not understand at all what to do. It is to be noted, however, that the sheep here that aren&rsquo;t on Faray are gimmers, which means that they are sheep who are first time mothers.</p>

<p>Returning to the farm, we did the byre and then came in for dinner. Marcus and I went out to look at the sunset because the sky was incredibly clear compared to what it has been. Unfortunately the sun was still covered by cloud so it wasn&rsquo;t as spectacular as it could have been.</p>

<p>Unspectacular here, though, is still pretty damn beautiful.</p>
