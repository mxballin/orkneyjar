<p>The Internet is back, and really I must catch up on writing&hellip;</p>

<p>Truthfully, though, even if there had been Internet, I&rsquo;m not sure there would have been much to write about. For the most part, things have been much the same.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to go on quite a nice walk two days ago, and am hoping to pack a couple adventures up on the north bit of the island, which I have yet to explore, before my trip comes to a close a week from yesterday.</p>

<p>What else will come, who knows? There is snow in the forecast which is unbelievable, but the weather here hasn&rsquo;t been particularly pin-downable, so perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
