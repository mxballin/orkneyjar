<p>The flight to Kirkwall was both easy and short. It essentially was just boarding, having a cup of tea with a biscuit, and then preparing for landing. Getting my luggage and hopping on the local bus into town was just as quick and painless, and before I knew it the driver was very kindly directing me to where my lodgings were located.</p>

<p>After situating myself in my barren but very comfortably sized room at the Peedie Hostel, I decided to take a walk around to find something to eat. </p>

<p>My feet, however, had other plans than my stomach. After taking a wrong turn, I ended up taking probably an hour’s walk though the more residential bit of Kirkwall.</p>

<p>All of those houses look primarily the same. They are built out of some sort of cement like mix that seems to be mostly small pebbles.</p>

<p>The quaintest bits are the small window dressings and doorways that make each house a bit more distinct.</p>

<p>There seem to be a fair amount of churches here&hellip; I counted three on my short walk. The most impressive those was the St. Magnus cathedral, a large red brick building that looks both well worn and well taken care of.</p>

<p>Next to the St. Magnus cathedral, I found two castle-like structures which, upon further inspection, the Bishop and Earl’s palaces from who knows how long ago.</p>

<p>Upon further wandering, I finally managed to figure out where I was on the tiny map provided to me by the free guidebook I picked up from the hostel.</p>

<p>Noticing that it was near closing time for most of the restaurants, I high tailed it to a local fish and chips place called the Harbor Fry. £5,50 got me two large pieces of fried fish and a healthy portion of French fries. Believe me, I was quite enthused; the packaging alone was something I found to be quite delightful. The fish, though greasy, was very lightly fried compared to the stuff I am used to from back home, and the addition of salt and vinegar by the fry cook was incredibly tasty.</p>

<p>Coming back to my room with my cardboard boxclroudly proclaiming that I was to be eating <i>Fish and chips, real food. 150 years of fish &lsquo;n&rsquo; chips and still the nation&rsquo;s favorite</i>, I have been watching a soccer game and Jools Holland. If that doesn’t prove I’m in the UK I don’t know what would…</p>

<p>I don’t think it had quite set in yet that I am actually in a different country doing things that I find to be incredibly interesting and exciting. The only thing I’ve really felt so far is a dash of embarrassment because of my accent, and excitement for plans that I have for the coming weeks of the trip.</p>

<p>Maybe that just means that I am living in the moment. </p>
