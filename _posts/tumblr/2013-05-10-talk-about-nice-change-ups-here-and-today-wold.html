<p>Talk about nice change ups here and today wold definitely come to mind.</p>

<p>After finishing the byre, Mark, Marcus and I worked to get about a quarter of the cows out of the byres and onto the fields. This took up much of the morning and required a lot of shifting about of cows in order to make sure we were keeping back those calves that still needed to be watched carefully.</p>

<p>After letting the ones we selected out onto the field behind the farm, we herded them from there down the main road to the field that is next to Seal Skerry (all of the fields have names but I’ll be honest I only know them from hearing the names and not which is which). Herding them can go well or poorly at the drop of a hat. Thankfully this time it was on the calm side, I am told. If this was calm (running back and forth trying to catch wandering calves, pounding on the car door to make sure they kept moving from behind), I can’t imagine a rough move.</p>

<p>After that we came back in for lunch, then I went out with Mark to move more cows around to free up space in the byres while Marcus worked on fertilizing the fields. Essentially we shifted some of the cows in the main byre to the now mostly vacant slatted court (the smaller byre), and the cows in the smaller passages of the main byre to the now vacant larger passage.</p>

<p>We are down to 8 cows to calf, so the end is nigh. Once more and more cows are outside, manning the byre will—obviously—be much easier and attention, I think, will be turned to prepping for next year as well as taking care of the sheep who have yet to lamb.</p>

<p>The moving took essentially all day, and after it started to get quite windy although still astonishingly clear. I plan to go out tonight to take pictures of the stars.</p>

<p>I spent some time in the crash shed, which is where there is a set up so that multiple things such as tagging and hair clipping can be done to a cow at the same time while it is held in a bit of a restraint. The reason why I was there, however, is that there are several swallows nesting in the roof, and I was hoping to be able to get an up close shot of one or multiple of them. It was not meant to be, but the time in the quiet shed was still nice. I managed to snag a couple pictures of them in the air, regardless.</p>

<p>After dinner, Marcus and I ventured out to look at the sunset which once again lacked being absolutely spectacular, but a rainbow of color was enough to make me happy. I am starting to get a bit of windburn, though, so I need to make sure to be a bit more careful when bundling up for such excursions. Marcus says I look like an American tourist when I do, but as long as I’m protected from the cold and the wind, I’m not sure I particularly mind.</p>

<p>Coming back in, I switched bundles and then went out with Louise to feed the twins in their new passage of the byre. They seemed to be quite well adjusted, and took the milk as eagerly as usual. Their mother, Natasha, even gave my hair a tongue bath today.</p>

<p>We are going to start feeding another calf that is part of a set of twins because it has fallen behind in its growth. It will be a bit harder to do because he is older and less likely to want to suck from the bottle, but it must be done.</p>

<p>Not sure what is on the menu for tomorrow, but I am hoping both for another glorious day and another chance to observe the swallows.</p>
