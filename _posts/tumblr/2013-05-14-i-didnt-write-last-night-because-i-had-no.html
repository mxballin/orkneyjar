<p>I didn&rsquo;t write last night because I had no Internet nor energy, but now I&rsquo;m finding it hard to remember what I did. Oops.</p>

<p>Essentially I did the byre with Marcus and then worked with him to move more of the cows around to introduce them to me environments before they go outside (the ones still in the byres are either too young or needed to be de-horned, which Mark and Marcus did yesterday).</p>

<p>We then came in for an early lunch and a very leisurely rest.</p>

<p>After that Marcus went out for the dehorning and I stayed inside to read; unfortunately the weather has been quite rainy and stormy.</p>

<p>When the unpleasant bit were over and done with, I came out to help Mark and Marcus with various things around the farm before we started the routine.</p>

<p>Louise hasn&rsquo;t been feeling too well, so after finishing in the byre I went to make dinner while Mark and Marcus went out to make sure the sheep were in good order. Unfortunately for them, the weather had left a lot of cold lambs that had to be taken care of, which took several hours to sort out.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I had dinner with Georgina which was quite nice because I haven&rsquo;t gotten to know her all too well, and then made some sugar cookies for dessert.</p>

<p>After watching a movie with Marcus, we went out to check the moved sheep again to make sure that they were still keeping warm in their new location.</p>

<p>It really is interesting here how different time is. We went out at 1, which is when Marcus has an alarm set to go and check the cows as well. Louise usually gets up at 3 to do the same, and Mark at 5 and 7. Because taking care of so many animals is essentially a 24 hour job, rest periods are taken slowly, but really it is almost as if you are on duty all the time (though it should be said that the animals often can take care of themselves, of course). All the same, the atmosphere of work, because it is a constant thing, is much more relaxed and care driven, rather than powered by opening and closing hours. It makes everything seem much more natural and holistic, and I think is what keeps my interest and desire to work in stride.</p>

<p>Today has been quite rainy as well despite waking up to a bit of sun, so I am hopeful that things will clear up. Another trip to the beach or even just a walk around would be much enjoyed.</p>
