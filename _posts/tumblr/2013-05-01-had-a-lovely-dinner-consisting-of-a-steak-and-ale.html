<p>Had a lovely dinner consisting of a steak and ale pie accompanied by clapshot and vegetables.</p>

<p>Clapshot, defined by wikipedia, is: “…a traditional Scottish dish that originated in Orkneyand… It is created by the combined mashing of swede turnips and potatoes (“neeps and tatties”) with the addition of chives, butter or dripping, salt and pepper; some versions include onions.” </p>

<p>I’d definitely like to find a recipe as it was quite tasty.<br/>
After dinner (and a minor trip that thankfully damaged nothing other than leaving a very slight rub in my pants), I took a nice walk around the Peedie Sea as the sun set.</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel, I’ve set everything up so I can take the early boat tomorrow without having to wake up <i>too</i> early, and am now lounging around before bed.</p>

<p>Perhaps because I woke up as early as I did, I find myself surprisingly tired.</p>

<p>I’m excited for tomorrow as I was excited for today… That might be because I’ll be doing tomorrow what I was supposed to be doing today, though. Imagine that.</p>
