<p>Time really just slips by here. The days as they go seem long, but everything progresses so quickly, I can’t believe that I haven’t written in four days.</p>

<p>Not much—once again—to report.</p>

<p>The weather has been absolutely fantastic for the past couple of days. Wednesday, though, was a bit of an oddity as the weather was absolutely bipolar. At one moment it hailed, and the next it was so sunny I was down to a t-shirt.</p>

<p>Also on Wednesday, Mark went in to town for various appointments and brought home haggis for dinner. It was… Interesting. Not about to say it is something I would jump for joy to have again, but it also was not horrid.</p>

<p>I went on a lovely lovely walk early yesterday morning on the north bit of the island. Louise dropped me off near the shop, and I spent a bit of time looking at the Stone of Setter as well as Mill Loch, a small lake that is a resting place for many types of birds including the red throated diver (a type of loon). Also on my walk I got to see a couple of short horned owls which was exciting, not much else in terms of wildlife, though.</p>

<p>When I returned to Fersness for breakfast, much to my surprise, all of the cows were being let out of the byre! It has given me—and everyone else—much more time to relax and get other things done. Currently my only main job is to take care of the caddie lambs, whose numbers have now risen to 11.</p>

<p>I spent much of the morning helping to move the cows onto various fields, and then planted tomatoes for the greenhouse. After that I had a bit of free time so I baked some lovely cookies and then worked on making dinner.</p>

<p>The moon was spectacular last night (it will be full tonight), and I was glad to get a couple of nice pictures of it rising. Today has been, I almost will venture to say, one of the best days I have spent here, mainly because the weather has been absolutely spectacular. The high was a nice and sunny 54 degrees, so warm that I went for a dunk when Marcus took me to a beach just past Seal Skerry. I got to spend a nice bit of time with him, Meg, and Sally, before they went to roll a field, and then spent the time reading on a hill just above the beach. </p>

<p>The farm was being inspected today, I believe because the Cockrams belong to several schemes (groups working to create a high quality standard of farming) and receive grants from the government. As a result of that, and because the cows are out now, there wasn’t a whole lot for me to do upon returning from the beach.</p>

<p>I made another batch of cookies (they disappear quite quickly here), went to feed my calf in the field with Marcus as a ‘body guard,’ and then talked to Georgina for a while.</p>

<p>All in all, quite a holiday type day. I look forward to tomorrow, but not particularly to the prospect of going home the day after that. </p>

<p>Ruth came out from Faray today, and when I was talking to her she asked if I would want to come back, and I said I certainly would. It has been so lovely here, it seems like there wouldn’t be a doubt that I would jump at the chance to return.</p>

<p>For now, however, I plan on enjoying what little time I have left to the fullest.</p>
