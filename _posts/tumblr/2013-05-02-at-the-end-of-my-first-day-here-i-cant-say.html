<p>At the end of my first day here, I can&rsquo;t say anything other than that I am really happy with how things have worked out.</p>

<p>Working with the cows is incredibly peaceful. I&rsquo;ve been taught how to do a lot of the fringe tasks such as filling water and feeding the calves (I even got to bottle feed one, which I found to be quite exhilarating) and Marcus and Louise have always been around to answer my questions.</p>

<p>They talk a lot about how the cows have all sorts of personalities, and how working as closely as they do with them is something that not every farmer does. In general, the environment here is very gentle, and while there is a lot to do, there always seems to be time to take tea or have a somewhat lengthy meal.</p>

<p>At one point when there wasn&rsquo;t really much that I could help out with, I took a walk along the farm (which, I have come to realize is incredibly extensive; covering what I think is the majority of the west end of the island) I only managed to walk along one short bit of the land that edges along the sea and am definitely interested in wandering around other places to explore some of the abandoned crofts and such.</p>

<p>My room here is spacious and quite comfortable. There is unfortunately no space to put my clothes, so I will primarily keep everything in my suitcase, but I do have a desk, as well as a divan and a small little fireplace (although I wouldn&rsquo;t dare use it). The door slides rather than swings, and it is completely windows that have been covered with lace drapes. The main light switch&ndash;much to my intrigue&ndash;is a pull cord rather than a switch.</p>

<p>The house itself is quite comfortable, with a central kitchen and a living room a bit out of the way. Doors are pretty much always open, and the quiet of the outside is matched inside.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not completely sure as to what I should be doing in my free time, most likely I will try and read a bunch. When it is light out, I will plan to explore the farm a bit despite the rain&hellip; I myself don&rsquo;t mind it but it is a tad frustrating when it is so beautiful here and I can&rsquo;t really take many pictures with my digital cameras. I will have to try and rig up a rain cover tomorrow.</p>

<p>Starting hour is a lot later than I had expected&ndash;Louise just told me 8am&ndash;so I have a couple more hours to do things.</p>

<p>What those things will be are unknown, but most likely it will involve a cup of tea and a potentially good book.</p>
