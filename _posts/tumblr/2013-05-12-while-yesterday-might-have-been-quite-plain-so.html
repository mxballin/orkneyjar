<p>While yesterday might have been quite plain (so plain that I didn’t even write), today was quite the opposite.</p>

<p>I did the byre with Marcus after breakfast and then hopped on the Cockrams’ speedboat to go to Faray with Mark, his father, and another woman Ruth. The island was absolutely beautiful, and I quite enjoyed walking around it.</p>

<p>I spent a bit of time wandering on my own, and then came back to the house of Faray to watch what the family and those who work with them do with the sheep.</p>

<p>The first thing I saw gruesomely enough, was the chopped off head of a lamb being rubbed on another living lamb. I’ll be honest, I was a bit horrified in the first moment. The reason this was happening, though, was to try and adopt a lamb on to a mother who had lost her lambs from a mother who didn’t have enough milk to feed all of hers equally. What essentially happens is that the lamb to be adopted is rubbed down with parts of the dead lamb so as to make it smell like the lamb the mother would be looking for. It gets covered in various fluids from the body and then is slid into the skin. If ever there was a need for the term sheep in sheep’s clothing, it wold be now.</p>

<p>After that, some of the flock got into an area where the sheep who have already lambed and had their lambs for a while are. As a result, it was necessary for us to round them up by encircling those without lambs using ATV-like bikes, dogs, and us running alongside them. Boy, I thought running after sheep wouldn’t make me break a sweat, but they sure can move.</p>

<p>We came back to Eday, leaving Ruth on the island and taking Shell with us, who had gone to Faray a couple days after I arrived here.</p>

<p>Them it was back to the norm. I had lunch, and then because it was much later than usual went out to do the routine with Marcus.</p>

<p>Dinner was lovely, and afterwards I learned how to make a clootie dumpling, which is an Orcadian dessert that is essentially a moist fluffy cake with fruit in it, usually served with custard.</p>

<p>Marcus, Georgina and I then watched Skyfall.</p>

<p>Tomorrow should probably a slower day much like the past couple. I’m hoping to get a walk in during the afternoon.</p>
