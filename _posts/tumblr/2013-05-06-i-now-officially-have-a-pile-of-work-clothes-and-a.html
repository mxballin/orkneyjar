<p>I now officially have a pile of work clothes and a pile of non work clothes, otherwise everything would pretty much smell of the byre. Although admittedly it’s sometimes hard to tell if this system is working as my hair seems to be quite absorbent of the smell as well.</p>

<p>This morning I helped prepare things for the new trip over to Faray, and then helped Marcus with the byre. More prep came after.</p>

<p>Sally was so silly today; Louise had taken out powdered milk for orphaned sheep and took some to keep for here just in case as the rest would be on Faray, and when everyone was observing the swallows that have just returned to nest in one of the storage barns, she wiggled her way into the bag and got a couple licks of the stuff. When we stopped her, her entire face was covered in the stuff and it made her look like bearded old man.</p>

<p>After everything was packed up, the boat was ready for launch. I went down to watch and got to talk a bit with Eday’s ranger, Jennie, who was going over for a quick trip to observe the birds that are on the other island. She seems quite nice and very enthusiastic about her job. In a couple weeks she’ll be leading a hike on the north side of the island, which I hope to attend.</p>

<p> I had a fair amount of time to myself after lunch which I used to study a couple maps of Eday and figure out where I might want to look around the next time I have some time off. There are a couple of already set walks that seem like they would be interesting, and in general it is fantastic that I can take advantage of the fact that I am living on Fersness as it means that I can explore a lot of area without feeling like I’m particularly trespassing (although everyone is so friendly here I’m not particularly sure if that is possible). </p>

<p>The boat came back in the afternoon minus a couple of those who had left and plus Mark, who is home now as his brother Adam is out to work with the sheep. After meeting him, once again I am blown away by how kind and welcoming this family is right from the get go. Man, am I lucky here.</p>

<p>After completing the afternoon rounds of the byre with Marcus, he and Mark went off to Faray again with another worker from Kirkwall who was going to stay there with Adam (she had missed the earlier ferry because there had been a time change due to strikes that she was unaware of). During that time since there wasn’t much to do I helped Louise cook a stew for dinner. It turned out incredibly tasty and I must say I was quite chuffed. </p>

<p>Aha! The use of a British slang word! I’ve been waiting to talk about this for a while. There are so many phrases and items that have different names here or that simply don’t translate into American English. It’s been quite fun trying to figure out what everything means. It is interesting as well because there are many phrases and words that are also not just specific to the UK but to Orkney. Cloot, for example, means cloth. Regardless, there are also American words that they don’t understand, and I have to describe what I am looking for in order to actually get what I seek. I asked Georgina when we were setting the table for potholders,  and she was confused until I told her what they were an then said ‘Oh, you mean oven gloves?’ Then of course there are things like kippers and marmite and the like that I just have no idea what they are because they don’t really crop up in America. I tried a concentrated black current drink called Ribena, which I had never heard of but Mark said that he grew up with and his father probably did too, yet I had never known of its existence until tonight. It is also quite funny when it comes to common household products that are known universally by one brand, even if what you have is of a different make, because at home I call it by a different brand. Buttery spread, for example, is called Flora, where at home I call it Brown&amp;Brummel (or is it Brummel&amp;Brown I can never actually remember the real name of it…).</p>

<p>Dinner was a bit late because of all of the trips to Faray, so without much of a sit around Louise and I went out as per usual to go and feed the pair of twins that we top off because their mother was sick and wasn’t making enough milk. They are doing much better as of now, but are still incredibly friendly which is quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>We fed the extra milk to the dogs (Mark has two as well), and then went out to the side of the byre to look at the last of the sunset (do note that this was half an hour ago at 23:15).</p>

<p>It was incredible how far out you could see and how peaceful everything sounded. While we were watching, we could even see one of the family on Faray biking out to check on the sheep because they were holding a torch (a flashlight). </p>

<p>I do certainly hope the sky is clear one of these nights. Until then I’m happy to see just a little taste of what sunsets and the night sky can look like.</p>
