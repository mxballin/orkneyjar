<p>Another day gone and the Internet is finally working again! It’s a shame that it comes and goes and always seems to be gone exactly when I want it to be around.<br/>
This morning I went through my regular routine and then helped Marcus clean out some of the pens of cows and their calves that had recently been born and were now going to stay in the same pens as those that had been born earlier. It also helped to clear a bit of space as two new calves were born last night and today. Marcus is currently checking on another cow who is calving at the moment so that means another pen filled soon enough.<br/>
After that we went up to scale to get more bales of hay as well as tend to the cows that are up there. The ride up was loads of fun as I had never ridden in a tractor for a long distance  and  the dogs tagged along which meant that I got to pet Sally the entire way. She’s such a lovely dog, as is Meg who is the older of the two.<br/>
Coming back we went down to one of the beaches on the farm and collected seaweed (Marcus calls them tangles) for the calves to eat. It is a tradition on the farm for them to be fed it, although the actual purpose is kind of unknown, most likely for minerals.<br/>
While we were down there, there was a common seal that was tootling about the bay, which was fun to watch. I also got to explore around and found a sea snail as well as a small crab. The most common wildlife that one sees on the beaches here are limpets (little shelled creatures that stick like suction cups to the rock) and various gulls and birds.<br/>
Lunch was a bit of an adventure as well as I tried custard for the first time as well as a type of pickle, which is essentially a mix of various cut up vegetables that have been pickled. I’ve already tried marmite which is… not terrible but not something I would look to eat again. I’ve been told that I will at some point be trying haggis as well as other traditional Orcadian foods such as bannock (a type of bread, I’ve been told).<br/>
After lunch I took a moment to brush my hair as it always seems to have a bit of straw in it, and then went back out to the byre to clear out the remaining silage from a feed pen as well as tie up the seaweed for the calves to eat. I learned two types of knots in order to do so, the clover hitch and the granny knot. It took me an embarrassingly long amount of time for me to figure them out, but such is life.<br/>
Marcus had a giant list of things to do after my tasks were done, but none of them were particularly things that I could help out with, so I went for a walk along the bay to the quarry. The shores of Eday are quite littered, mainly with buoys that have been lost due to wind. Along the way I found a fair number of lobster traps as well as old rusted equipment that I presume had been used while the quarry was in business. Many buildings too are like this. Perhaps it’s just that people don’t see the need to tear things down, rather let them weather the test of time. It is a statement that doesn’t really show up in California at all… the closest thing I can think of are old property fences and bird houses that are left over up on skyline from when the preserves were privately owned.<br/>
Coming back from my walk, there still wasn’t much for me to do, and so I ended up offering to prepare the salad that Louise was planning on for dinner. It also gave me a bit of time to talk to Georgina and get to know her a bit better which was nice. My presentation skills were complimented when the salad was served, so a clearly my photographing of food has payed of just a little bit.<br/>
After dinner Marcus, Georgina and I met up with their cousin Adam as well as another friend John to play football. It was a bunch of fun and, because it was so clear out, I got to see a proper sunset for the first time here on the island.<br/>
Coming back we watched the first half of the Hobbit and now I’m here writing this post. Funny how recounting works.<br/>
Mark comes home from Faray tomorrow, and there is a possibility that I might take a day trip out there sometime soon with one of the family just to have a look around (and perhaps another more extended trip to help out if the timing of the people they have coming in doesn’t end up working). It turns out that the Cockrams rent the entire island for their sheep. I definitely thought it was only one little section, but man. Here on Eday they have about 1,500 acres, I think Marcus said the other day, but a lot of it is hilly, which is why Faray is a better option for the sheep. I think it would be exciting to have a look around the island as it hasn’t been populated in years. Have yet to take a look at the book Louise lent me in it, but I will probably take a look soon.<br/>
Otherwise I don’t really know what is on the menu for tomorrow. Hopefully it will be as sunny as it was this afternoon… The weather was absolutely perfect; I only needed to wear a long sleeve shirt.</p>
