<p>I won’t lie and say I didn’t shed a few tears when I got on the boat this morning. In fact, I got quite watery when I was saying goodbye to the dogs before I left the farm.</p>

<p>The past 27 days that I have been here in Scotland have been absolutely incredible, and there is no doubt that I would jump at the chance to come back; probably even to the same place.</p>

<p>It was so easy on Eday to get sucked up into work and the surroundings and just living that I never really felt like there was much of a rush to be anywhere. Things would happen when they happened, tasks would get done as long as you were working on them, and really nothing ever felt like it was tiring or undesirable.</p>

<p>I spent my last day yesterday doing less that I had originally planned, mainly because I wanted to stay around the farm. I didn’t have any jobs other than taking care of the lambs, so I went and kept Marcus company while he was rolling Dale, one of the fields.</p>

<p>I walked back for lunch, and then we went back out to Ernie&rsquo;s beach, which is where we had been yesterday, and wandered about until it was time to come back for dinner.</p>

<p> After washing up, Louise took me around in the Ranger to see some of the island that I hadn&rsquo;t had the chance to see yet. It was quite interesting to see how different much of the island is from the west side, primarily because it is farmed by much more than two families only. The farms are much closer together and it seems much more crowded (crowded as crofts can be, which really isn&rsquo;t crowded at all).</p>

<p>I woke up quite early this morning to make sure that everything was packed well and was ready to go. Unfortunately, the ferry times didn&rsquo;t work too well with my flight, and so I had to take the early ferry that gave me a couple of hours in Kirkwall rather than the later one which would have given me most of the morning at Fersness.</p>

<p>I ate breakfast with Georgina and Marcus, and then bid farewell to the lambs, the dogs, the cows, Marcus and Mark. Georgina and Louise drove me to the ferry.</p>

<p>I wandered around Kirkwall for a while, stopping in a couple shops, etc., and then took the bus to the airport. Again, the timing was a bit awkward, and so I spent an hour or two waiting for the departure gate to open (one doesn&rsquo;t even go through security until your flight is getting ready to board). </p>

<p>I currently am sitting in the Aberdeen airport with a bottle of Ribena and two candy bars that I am both tempted to save and tempted to eat. What the outcome will be, I am unsure.</p>

<p>I really do hope that I am able to keep in touch with the Cockrams, and that I will be able to travel to Orkney again. This experience has been incredibly enriching for me, and I find myself wishing that I had more time, despite my original assumption that a month would be plenty&ndash;if not too much&ndash;time. I have learned about farming, a different culture, but most importantly I think that I have been able to learn a lot about taking things slowly, and savoring the tasks at hand. I hope to be able to apply this to whatever I do moving forward, and to be able to look back and be proud of the fact that I have been able to do so.</p>
