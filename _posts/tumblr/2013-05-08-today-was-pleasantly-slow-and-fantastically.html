<p>Today was pleasantly slow, and fantastically sunny.</p>

<p>After doing the byre with Mark, I went out with him to work with the sheep doing the same thing, and also taking a couple up the road to a pasture of other sheep.</p>

<p>We returned for lunch. I learned how to make bere bannock, which is two Orcadian traditions in one. Bannock, as previously mentioned, is a thick type of bread often eaten with cheese qnd butter. Bere is an ancient grain that is essentially only grown now for tradition; it only grows here and is milled primarily on the mainland. I was quite good, and I&rsquo;m proud of how they turned out. The taste is much like a dryer and denser English muffin, I would say&hellip; Perhaps a cross between that and whole wheat pita bread.</p>

<p>I had a bit of a break which I used to hunt for eggs (I had found a couple this morning) and observe the robin chicks, which Marcus and I had found hatched in the polytunnel just yesterday! Very exciting.</p>

<p>Louise and I then headed up the road again to dig up some potatoes to send over to Faray this weekend as well as to keep for ourselves and the chickens/ducks. At first we weren&rsquo;t particularly successful, but after moving over a couple rows, there were some that came up as big as my fist if not bigger. Also in the dirt that was forked up was a worm as long as my hand and as thick as my finger.</p>

<p>The byre was waiting for me when we got back&ndash;both Louise and I had lost track of time&ndash; and then I helped prepare dinner. It was the first time I had tried liver, which was an interesting experience. Not one hundred percent sure that I like it, but so it goes.</p>

<p>After dinner and a couple cups of tea, Louise and I went out to feed the twins. They were just as friendly and eager to suck as usual, and it really has become an incredibly fun and enjoyable routine. Tonight one of them decided to try and chew on my hair while I rubbed its neck. I doubt it tasted particularly good, though. He didn&rsquo;t keep at it for long.</p>

<p>The Internet has gone out again, so I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll end up posting this. But, for now, that is pretty much it.</p>
