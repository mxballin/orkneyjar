<p>Yesterday overall was quite nice.</p>

<p>I spent the morning doing the byre and various sundries, and then was taken out to the beach by Marcus, where I then stayed to wander while he did other tasks.</p>

<p>I did manage to take a dip in the water despite it being freezing, and in general it was a fabulous time to be there as the sun felt fantastic.</p>

<p>I came back to the farm when it was starting to get a bit breezy, and soon the cloud cover came over. As I am learning, typical Orkney.</p>

<p>After lunch and a quick rest, Marcus and I went out to roll a field, which essentially means going over it with a giant rolling pin attached to a tractor to make sure that the ground is flat.</p>

<p>I learned&ndash;sort of&ndash;how to very slowly drive a tractor which was a bit nerve wracking and a bit exhilarating at the same time.</p>

<p>Sally and Meg rode along in the tractor with us, and Marcus has his music set up to the radio, so it was overall quite fun despite the fact that the actual work was quite monotonous driving.</p>

<p>We returned to Fersness for a cup of tea, and then went out for the second round of the routine, which was finished pleasantly quickly.</p>

<p>I have been put in charge of the caddie lambs that we have brought home from Faray to take care of, which is both fun and tedious. The milk they drink is kept in a temperature maintaining device that tends to breed bacteria because of the warm water, and so after a while it begins to smell. Thankfully we clean everything out every day.</p>

<p>The peace and quiet here is really felt in everything that goes on, even the stuff that requires hard work. It really is what I like the best about here; the fresh air, the natural feel, and the lovely people.</p>
