<p>Woke up early and haven&rsquo;t been able to go back to sleep. Instead, I have once again taken advantage of the television to watch a children&rsquo;s show called The Hoobs.</p>

<p>It is bright and rainy out. I have plans to shower and find a good ATM&ndash;I saw a sign for a surcharge free one yesterday but didn&rsquo;t stop because I wanted to get un-lost&ndash;before stopping at a local bakery that has received great reviews for breakfast and probably to grab a sandwich for lunch&hellip; On their website they also mentioned fudge. How exciting!</p>
