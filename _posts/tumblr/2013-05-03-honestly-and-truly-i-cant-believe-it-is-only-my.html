<p>Honestly and truly, I can&rsquo;t believe it is only my second day here.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it has been forever or some cheesy statement of the like, but on the farm the tasks that get done have a very homelike feeling to them that make it easy to get used to them.</p>

<p>I woke up this morning 20 minutes late after waking up two hours early and returning to sleep (embarrassingly enough), quickly downed some corn flakes, and headed out to help in the byre. Marcus told me to do the &ldquo;same as before&rdquo; which essentially amounts to making sure that the cows have clean straw and enough water and silage (pickled grass that acts as their primary food source). We go through the main byre and then the other, smaller barn. Marcus then usually heads up to &ldquo;Scale,&rdquo; which is where his grandparents live and where the farm keeps the cows they are fattening to sell.</p>

<p>Today instead of going with him, I took on starting to clear out one of the farm&rsquo;s polytunnels&ndash;essentially a greenhouse&ndash;that has been overtaken by thistles. The plants are annoyingly sharp (surprise surprise), but for the most part I can use a small pitchfork instead of my hands to dig them up.</p>

<p>In the polytunnel, we found a robin sitting on a nest of eggs. She flew to the back of the tunnel when we started looking at her, but she was happy back in the nest when I left for lunch.</p>

<p>Other animals of interest found in the polytunnel: bees. There are many types of bees here, but so far I think I have only seen one species. Regardless, it is quite common across the board for them to have white tails. Very strange to see the first time around.</p>

<p>After de-thistling and lunch, I took a bit of a break and went on a nice walk up the hill to get a better view of the bay that the farm is next to (the sea is literally on the other side so it isn&rsquo;t much a bay, but such is being on an island), and clambered around the abandoned buildings that I mentioned yesterday. There were an incredibly large amount of gulls and oyster catchers which were both very fun to watch. I also saw another rabbit, but it ran away before I could really get a good look (read: ogle over its cuteness).</p>

<p>In walking up the road to the top of the hill, I also walked past those sheep that aren&rsquo;t on Faray at the moment. It was a bit of a humorous moment as they were pretty sure I had food for them and thus started running towards me as I passed. I ended up a bit of a disappointment in that respect.</p>

<p>Coming back to the farm I went back to my gardening work for a bit and then went to help with the second round of byre work. The calves were quite friendly when I was in their pens today I which was enjoyable. Most scamper away from you as you start walking towards them, but some will pause for a moment to sniff your fingers if you stick your hand out slowly. Those that get bottle fed are much more friendly, but it is primarily because, much like the sheep, they always assume you come bearing food. My fingers and the button of the jumpsuit (which is essentially what my overalls are) have been sucked on more than once by several of these calves.</p>

<p>Fersness breeds their cows through AI, which means&ndash;Marcus explained to me yesterday&ndash;that they can get purer hybrid mixes out of them. There is one specifically that is a mix of three British breeds, and has so far been one of their best. One of the calves that is such breed actually came up to me today and didn&rsquo;t really let me pet him, but did lick my fingers when I stuck them out as well as pat him on the head for a bit.</p>

<p>After finishing that up, I came in and helped cook dinner. My favorite thing about the food here is that everything is prepared with comfort in mind. Because Eday is a pretty small island, variety is limited, and many things are canned, dried or packaged frozen. Regardless, there hasn&rsquo;t been a dish I&rsquo;ve disliked and meals for the most part remain quite balanced. I&rsquo;ve been encouraged several times to take more and asked more times than that whether I&rsquo;ve had enough. </p>

<p>Really, I think that represents a lot of what the feel is like here. The island is clean and fresh, and the farm is much like what one would expect a classic Scottish farm to be like. Rolling hills, a couple of farm dogs, weather than can change in the blink of an eye, some appliances that are older than I am, things that have been prepared DIY style (my favorite is the toilet that has a whoopie cushion in it because calling the plumber would mean a boat trip to mainland Orkney). At the same time, though Eday might seem like its in the boonies, there are several television sets in the house, an Xbox in Marcus&rsquo;s room, and the wifi that I am using right now. The old and new mix together in a way that makes this place a pleasant blend of rustic and current. There is everything you could want and more, and at the same time the charm of things that are just being scraped together with the resources available.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it was fantastically sunny today with only a short shower right before lunch, I have been told that the forecast predicts sleet or hail tonight. Hopefully that won&rsquo;t carry over into tomorrow so I can do a bit more adventuring, but if it does it will give me the chance to browse of the several books that have been loaned to me by Louise detailing the history of Eday and Faray.</p>

<p>Maybe it will also give me the opportunity to take some pictures around the farm a bit more.</p>

<p>If the calves will stay still for me&hellip;</p>
