<p>Though we kept to ourselves last night, the woman I was sharing a room with tonight was lovely to talk to this morning. She is here from Canada (though she has lived on skye with family before and visits the UK often) for masters work studying Scottish courting customs, and was really just a pleasure to talk to in general. Funnily enough she mentioned how unusually cold it is here. From her experience and from talking to others, they are currently about a month behind schedule in terms of warmth. </p>

<p>Currently, I am very much enjoying an apple muesli muffin top (yes, it was literally just the top in the package) provided by Virgin Atlantic on my flight over that I hadnâ€™t eaten but rather saved for this very purpose. Hurrah for thinking ahead. After. Filling up my water bottle and doing a last check to make sure nothing is left, I will be on my way to the ferry and forth into adventure.</p>

<p>Cheesy, yes. But quite true all the same.</p>
