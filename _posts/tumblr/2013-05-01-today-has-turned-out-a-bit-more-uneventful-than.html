<p>Today has turned out a bit more uneventful than originally planned. After waking up two hours two early on my own accord and finding myself unable to fall asleep, I headed out, grabbed a breakfast sandwich from a local bakery, and set off to the visitor center. The bus I was planning to take out towards the attractions on the west side of the island—unbeknownst to me—only runs during the summer. Very frustrating. I went to the ferry office and they said I couldn’t buy the ticket now, but rather should buy it on board the ferry when I checked in at 1450. Two tasks down, nothing actually done.</p>

<p>The upside of this is that I have been able to explore Kirkwall a bit more, most notably the St. Magnus Cathedral which I was able to look around for a while. It turns out that it is <i>much</i> older than I originally thought; having been originally built in the mid1100s. The architecture was lovely to look at, and the cathedral was peacefully quiet.</p>

<p>After spending time there, I stopped in a little gift shop-cafe hybrid and had a lovely little meal of a slice of cheddar broccoli quiche, various fresh salads, and a milkshake (advertised as being real Orkney ice cream).</p>

<p>Wandering though a couple stores, I ended up back where I started and decided to check out the teensy museum at the end of the hostel’s block; The Orkney Wireless Museum. To be honest, I wasn’t super sure what it was, and skeptically assumed it was about the history of wifi or something of the like. I was quite wrong. Though, yes, it was small, crammed, and at points lacking the rudimentary information I desired (sacrificing it for the more complicated), the wireless museum is a museum dedicated to the history of the wireless radio. Its shelves are lined with pieces from as early as the 1920s, culminating primarily in transistors and memorabilia from WWII. Later objects include a jukebox from the 1950s which, as I was leaving, the custodian (their version of curator) asked if I recognized any of the bands. I did, but very few. </p>

<p>After spending probably half an hour paging through the museum’s seven volumes of WWII archival photos, I decided it was time to head over to catch the ferry, as I would have a solid 15 minutes there to get situated and figure out where to buy my ticket on board (as the receptionist in the office had told me to do earlier this morning). 15 minutes clearly was not enough for this silly brain, as I am writing this once again from the Peedie hostel. Better than missing a flight, but a missed ferry is still no fun.</p>

<p>What it did give me the chance to do, however, was to talk to my host Louise on the phone. She sounds delightful, and thankfully has a pretty standard accent that was absolutely understandable (one of my primary worries after listening to conversations while I was walking down the road before). It leaves me quite excited to get to know the family, not that if I hadn’t liked the sound of her voice I wouldn’t have wanted to, but when people sound nice in their voice, it definitely is an incentive…</p>

<p>Tomorrow, therefore, will be my actual ferry ride over. Given that I have to be in the boat quite early, I am almost hoping that I naturally wake up at 5:30 like today without any ramifications of feeling tired.</p>

<p>Tonight most likely I will just read. There is a restaurant at the hotel next store that looked pretty reasonable, so I will probably take the easy route and get a bite there and then just spend time in the room reading or editing photos.

</p><p>There is a small lake like thing next to the hostel called Peedie Sea (peedie is the Orcadian word for small), which at last glance this morning had at least a dozen swans. Maybe there will be a path to walk around it. </p>

Regardless, the sky is beautiful and the clouds aren’t rain clouds, so despite the immense wind I probably should at least mosey along outside for a bit more… Especially since the sun doesn’t set for another five hours.
